The inclusion of a program should not be interpreted as an endorsement from us. In the last few years, new technology has been producing new types of genetic data, and the scope of genetic analyses changes dramatically. It is no longer obvious whether a program should be included or excluded from this list. Topics such as next-generation-sequencing (NGS), gene expression, genomics annotation, etc. can all be relevant to a genetic study, but we’ll have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to include a program. History This list was created by Dr. Wentian Li when he was at Columbia University (1995-1996). It was later moved to Rockefeller University (1996-2002) and then to the North Shore LIJ Research Institute (2002-2013), maintained by Jurg Ott, who then passed it on to his former student Gao Wang in 2015. More than 240 programs were listed by December 2004, close to 400 programs by December 2006, close to 480 programs by November 2008, and over 600 programs by October 2012. Since 2015, the list takes its home on github to facilicate potential contributions from the community. R packages More and more packages are now written in R. To be consistent, any R package in CRAN has been renamed from [package-name] to R/[package-name]. If an R package is not submitted to CRAN, its original name has been kept. Other lists Other genetic software lists can be found here. Search this repository You can use github’s search bar on the top of the repository, or the search icon at the top of this HTML site. Type in the keywords you care and see what you can find in this list! Contribute We welcome your input! To contribute, please provide information of the software in markdown format by this template. You may include less properties of the software than the template suggests (for example it may not have a version number or executable names), or more properties as you see fit. Once you have completed the *.md file, you may either fork this repository, add the *.md file to pages folder, commit and send a github pull request, or you can simply email the *.md file to gaow@uchicago.edu preferably with the phrase “Rockefeller List” in your email subject. You are welcome to both add new software and make improvement to contents on existing software on the list. Comments Published software programs might have their user email-list or forum for technical discussions on usage and features of the software but they do not provide a general review that may be helpful to new customers who are shopping around trying to decide which product to go for. This list provides a “Review” section for each program so that users can review the program and make recommendations to potential users. Link to “Review” sections are found at the end of program detail pages. Please also use this section to leave suggestions you have to pages on this list (please do not open any new issues for this).

ADEGENET Related R/ADEGENET ADMIXMAP Full Name Admixture mapping Version 3.7 (2007) Description ADMIXMAP is a general-purpose program for modelling admixture, using marker genotypes and trait data on a sample of individuals from an admixed population (such as African-Americans), where the markers have been chosen to have extreme differentials in allele frequencies between two or more of the ancestral populations between which admixture has occurred. The main difference between ADMIXMAP and classical programs for estimation of admixture such as ADMIX is that ADMIXMAP is based on a multilevel model for the distribution of individual admixture in the population and the stochastic variation of ancestry on hybrid chromosomes. This makes it possible to model the associations of ancestry between linked marker loci, and the association of a trait with individual admixture or with ancestry at a linked marker locus.

AMELIA Full Name Allele Matching Empirical Locus-specific Integrated Association test Description AMELIA is a program that employs allele matching to analyse the effects of rare variants within a specific locus. There is increasing evidence that rare variants play a role in some complex traits, but their analysis is not straightforward. Locus-based tests become necessary due to low power in rare variant single-point association analyses. In addition, variant quality scores are available for sequencing data, but are rarely taken into account. To enable this analysis, AMELIA has been developed as an allele-matching approach that is robust to the presence of both directions of effect for variants within the locus analysed.

APL-OSA then tests the relationship between the association statistics (i.e., the APL statistics) calculated based on the subset and the family-specific covariate. APL-OSA is based on the OSA method for linkage and the family-based association test, APL. Thus, APL-OSA has similar properties with OSA and APL. Bi-alleleic markers such as SNPs are accepted by APL-OSA. APL-OSA is a single-marker test and considers one covariate each time. Author Elizabeth R.

[abstract] ARIEL Full Name Accumulation of Rare variants Integrated and Extended Locus-specific test Description ARIEL explores the effects of rare variants within complex traits through locus-based analysis. There is increasing evidence that rare variants play a role in some complex traits, but their analysis is not straightforward. Locus-based tests become necessary due to low power in rare variant single-point association analyses. In addition, variant quality scores are available for sequencing data, but are rarely taken into account. To enable this analysis, ARIEL has been developed as a locus-wide regression-based collapsing approach that incorporates variant quality scores.

This refinement utilizes a mixture model in which a disease mutation segregates in only a fraction of the sibships, with the rest of the sibships unlinked. Covariate information is used to predict membership within the two groups corresponding to the linked and unlinked sibships. The pre-clustering model uses covariate information to first form two probabilistic clusters and then tests for excess IBD-sharing in the clusters. The Cov-IBD model determines probabilistic group membership by joint consideration of covariate and IBD values.

EAGLET uses multiple subsamples of dense SNP data to detect linkage with increased power, and to construct sharp 95% confidence intervals for the true trait location. Subsamples with minimal amounts of LD are repeatedly drawn from the original dense SNP data, and the linkage information across subsamples is then combined. This minimizes the false positive evidence for linkage that LD can create in classical multipoint linkage analysis due to an apparent excess in allele sharing among affecteds. Another attractive feature of EAGLET is that by using multiple subsamples, as opposed to one, EAGLET’s estimate of trait location is greatly improved. EAGLET can be used to generate subsamples for custom linkage packages as well, and computes standard LD statistics via the EM algorithm. Author William C.L.

ExomePicks assumes that a genotyping chip or another cost effective means will be used to determine IBD sharing in the pedigree and that, subsequently, one would like to sequence a minimal number of individuals and use their sequences together with IBD information to deduce the sequence of other individuals in the pedigree. We are currently using it in the context of whole exome and whole genome sequencing studies to pick individuals to be sequenced from large family collections.

It can be used both for population data (case-control) and nuclear family data. The program is optimized for haplotype frequency estimation with the EM-algorithm for many markers. FAMHAP provides a method which searches for potential genotyping errors and several tests for haplotype-based association analysis. Particular emphasis is on Monte-Carlo simulations, which are necessary in the context of haplotype association, where asymptotic theory often fails, and in the context of multiple testing problems.

The method extends the approach for testing described in Rabinowitz and Laird (2000) to handle multiple tightly linked markers. It is robust to population admixture, yet efficient in the sense that it utilizes data from families where phase cannot be completely resolved in all individuals by using weights, which are estimated from the sample. However, the method remains robust to population stratification and population admixture. The method can handle any type of phenotype, including multiple phenotypes and missing parents, marker data, and/or phase, and provides both bi-allelic and multi-allelic tests. PowerFBAT is a tool for power simulation of association analysis using FBAT with binary outcomes. XWXW is an extension to the Haseman-Elston method for non-parametric linkage test with quantitative traits. XDT is a software that performs classical TDT, “SDT” and “Rabinowitz TDT” for nuclear families (not supported anymore).

The approach can handle markers in LD and can simulate datasets over large regions such as whole chromosomes. Hapgen simulates haplotypes by conditioning on a set of population haplotypes and an estimate of the fine-scale recombination rate across the region. The disease model is specified through the choice of a single SNP as the disease causing variant together with the relative risks of the genotypes at the disease SNP. The program is designed to work with publically available files that contain the haplotypes estimated as part of the HapMap project and the estimated fine-scale recombination map derived from that data. Hapgen is computationally tractable. On a modern desktop HAPGEN can simulate several thousand case and control data on a whole chromosome at Hapmap Phase 2 marker density within minutes. This program has been used to assess the power of several different commercially available genotyping chips, in the design stage of the 7 genome-wide association studies carried out by the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) and for evaluating the power of different methods for detecting association in genome-wide studies.

Commonly fairly simple methods, such as two- or three-SNP sliding windows are used to create haplotypes across large regions, but these may be of limited value when adjacent SNPs are in strong LD and provide redundant information. We have created a novel program, “HaploBuild” for constructing and testing haplotypes for SNPs in close physical proximity to one another but which are not necessarily contiguous. Furthermore, the number of SNPs contained in the haplotype is not restricted, thereby permitting the evaluation of complex haplotype structures.

If the genotypes are from pooled DNA, the program assumes that every pool contains the same number of individuals and the individuals were chosen at random when placed into the pools. For a reasonable running-time, the number of individuals in a pool needs to be between 2 and 4.

JLIN Full Name a Java based LINkage disequilibrium plotter Version 1.5.2 (March 2006) Description JLIN (Java LINkage disequilibrium plotter) is designed for customisable, intuitive visualisation of LD analysis across all common computing platforms. Customisation allows the researcher to choose particular visualisation, statistical measures and measurement ranges. JLIN also allows the researcher to export images of the LD visualisation in several common document formats. As there appears to be no single best measure of LD under all possible circumstances, JLIN allows the researcher to visually compare and contrast the results of a range of statistical measures on the input data set(s). These measures include the commonly used D’ and R2 statistics and empirical p-values. New additions include calculation of HWE, a completely revamped interface, and a numer of minor bug fixes. We have added a display measure to show marker distances visually, embedded fonts to improve image clarity and additional LD measures including d,OR,Pexcess and Q.

It carries out case-control association testing for rare variants for whole exome association studies. Briefly, consider a gene of length N which harbors M rare variants. Genotype on the M variant sites &amp; the disease status (case/control) are known for each individual. The program takes as input the M-site genotype and disease status (case/control) data files, and computes a p value indicating the significance of association. In order to speed up permutation testing we use an “adaptive” approach to obtain p values.

MAOS Full Name Meta-Analysis with Overlapping Subjects Description Data from genome-wide association studies are often analyzed jointly for the purposes of combining information from multiple studies of the same disease or comparing results across different disorders. In many instances, the same subjects appear in multiple studies. Failure to account for overlapping subjects can greatly inflate type I error when combining results from multiple studies of the same disease and can drastically reduce power when comparing results across different disorders. MAOS implements valid and efficient statistical methods for meta-analysis of genomewide association studies with overlapping subjects.

In particular, the whole genome is first partitioned into multiple short subgenomes and a boosting tree classifier is built for each subgenomes based on multi-SNP interactions and then used to measure the importance of SNPs. The method keeps relatively more important SNPs from all subgenomes and let them compete with each other in the same way at the next level. The competition terminates when the number of selected SNPs is less than the size of a subgenome.

This model also allows the user to estimate recombination rates, and identify recombination hotspots from population genotype data. (3) the facility to perform a test for haplotype frequency differences between cases and controls. (4) more extensive output summarising the results.

PIAGE Full Name Power of Indirect Association Studies of Gene-Environment Interactions Version 1.0 (March 2008) Description The program PIAGE performs estimation of power and sample sizes required to detect genetic and environmental main, as well as gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects in indirect matched case-control studies (1:1 matching). When the hypothesis of GxE is tested, power/sample size will be estimated for the detection of GxE, as well as for the detection of genetic and environmental marginal effects. Furthermore, power estimation is implemented for the joint test of genetic marginal and GxE effects (Kraft P et al., 2007). Power and sample size estimations are based on Gauderman’s (2002) asymptotic approach for power and sample size estimations in direct studies of GxE. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and independence of genotypes and environmental exposures in the population are assumed. The estimates are based on genotypic codes (G=1 (G=0) for individuals who carry a (non-) risk genotype), which depend on the mode of inheritance (dominant, recessive, or multiplicative). A conditional logistic regression approach is used, which employs a likelihood-ratio test with respect to a biallelic candidate SNP, a binary environmental factor (E=1 (E=0) in (un)exposed individuals), and the interaction between these components.

Large scale genotyping data and complex pedigrees can be efficiently simulated. QMSim is a family based simulator, which can also take into account predefined evolutionary features, such as LD, mutation, bottlenecks and expansions. The simulation is basically carried out in two steps: In the first step, a historical population is simulated to establish mutation-drift equilibrium and, in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be complex. QMSim allows for a wide range of parameters to be incorporated in the simulation models in order to produce appropriate simulated data.

RECORD Full Name REcombination Counting and ORDering Version 2005 and 2006 Description RECORD can be used for the ordering of loci on genetic linkage maps. The method is based on minimisation of the total number of recombination events. Since the criterion does not require intensive calculations, the algorithm rapidly produces an optimal ordering as well as a series of near-optimal ones. The latter provides insight into the local certainty of ordering along the map. RECORD can deal with the following types of mapping populations: BC1, F2, F3, RILs (in fact any generation obtained by repeated selfing of a hybrid between homozygous parents). Data files are .LOC JoinMap format. Mapping populations from non-inbreds should be split into BC1 or HAP data that represent the maternal and paternal gametes.

SEQUENCE LD/SEQUENCE LDHOT Description The program sequenceLD analyzes sequence data. It obtains an approximation to the likelihood of a summary of the data (as such it can be thought of as a marginal likelihood approach). It does not use all the information in the data, but computationally it can be substantially more efficient than the full-likelihood methods (and hence able to analyze larger data sets). The program sequenceLDhot is a method for detecting recombination hotspots from population genetic data. It takes as input phased (i.e. haplotype) data, together with an estimate of the background recombination rate within the region (this is allowed to vary across the region). Then sequenceLDhot considers a grid of putative hotspot positions, and for each putative hotspot calculates a likelihood ratio statistics for the presence of a hotspot.

Missing values and scoring errors can severely influence the calculated marker order. The software tool SMOOTH recognises and removes the most unrealistic data points. This software was used to construct the 10,000 marker potato map. The removal of improbable data point is a good medicine for linkage maps, that is not easily overdosed. One error is more harmfull than ten missing values. The software was never intended as user-friendly software. In these days it would be more useful to re-do the programming of the pascal source code into a perl script.

SPLAT Full Name Sib Pair Linkage Analysis Testing Version 1.0 (2006) Description SPLAT can calculate virtually any linkage test statistic under several sib pair study designs: affected, discordant, unaffected, and pairs defined by threshold values for quantitative traits, such as extreme discordant sib pairs. It uses the EM algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates of sharing (subject to any user-specified domain restrictions or null hypotheses) and then plots lod scores versus chromosomal position. It includes a novel grid scanning capability that enables simultaneous visualization of multiple test statistics. Phenotype definitions can be modified without recalculating inheritance vectors, thereby providing considerable analytical flexibility.

It detects homozygous SNPs and indels by aligning shotgun reads to the finished genome sequence. Highly repetitive elements are filtered out by ignoring those kmer words with high occurrence numbers. For those less repetitive or non-repetitive reads, we place them uniquely on the reference genome sequence and find the best alignment according to the pair-wise alignment score if there are multiple seeded regions. From the best alignment, SNP candidates are screened, taking into account the quality value of the bases with variation as well as the quality values in the neighbouring bases, using neighbourhood quality standard (NQS). For insertions/deletions, we check if the same indel is mapped by more than one read, ensuring the detected indel with high confidence.

(2005) to test for association between genetic markers and phenotypes in case-control studies using haplotype information. The potential value of haplotypes has attracted widespread interest in the mapping of complex traits. Haplotype sharing methods take into account linkage disequilibrium information between multiple markers, and may have good power to detect predisposing genes. We present a new approach based on Mantel statistics for space time clustering, which we developed in order to improve the power of haplotype sharing analysis for gene mapping in complex disease. The new statistic correlates genetic similarity and phenotypic similarity across pairs of haplotypes for case-only and case-control studies. The genetic similarity is measured as the shared length between haplotypes around a putative disease locus. Alternative measures for the phenotypic similarity were implemented.

["v-1.html", "V VAAST Variant Association Tools Variant Tools VARSCAN VG VH VITESSE", " V VAAST Full Name Variant Annotation, Analysis and Search Tool Description VAAST is a probabilistic search tool for identifying damaged genes and their disease-causing variants in personal genome sequences. VAAST builds upon existing amino acid substitution (AAS) and aggregative approaches to variant prioritization, combining elements of both into a single unified likelihood-framework that allows users to identify damaged genes and deleterious variants with greater accuracy, and in an easy-to-use fashion. VAAST can score both coding and non-coding variants, evaluating the cumulative impact of both types of variants simultaneously. VAAST can identify rare variants causing rare genetic diseases, and it can also use both rare and common variants to identify genes responsible for common diseases. VAAST thus has a much greater scope of use than any existing methodology.

Tag NGS variant filtering, annotation VARSCAN Description VarScan is a platform-independent, technology-independent software tool for identifying SNPs and indels in massively parallel sequencing of individual and pooled samples. Given data for a single sample, VarScan identifies and filters germline variants based on read counts, base quality, and allele frequency. Given data for a tumor-normal pair, VarScan also determines the somatic status of each variant (Germline, Somatic, or LOH) by comparing read counts between samples.
