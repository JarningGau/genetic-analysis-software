[GCHAP]
FULL_NAME=Gene Counting method for HAPlotype analysis.
DESCRIPTION=This program finds maximum likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies from a sample of genotyped individuals. By excluding haplotypes with zero MLE at an early stage, this implementation uses many orders of magnitude less space and time than naive implementations. A second program, ApproxGCHap, is provided to give alternate estimates for data sets with large numbers of loci or large amounts of missing genotypes.
