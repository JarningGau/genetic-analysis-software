[GENOOM]
FULL_NAME=GENetic Object Oriented Modeling in population genetics
VERSION=3.66 (November 2003)
DESCRIPTION=GENOOM implements a virtual computer world where biological entities are digital objects. In this world, each individual of a population is represented by a set of chromosomes with genetic elements (markers, genes, Quantitative Traits Loci, etc.) and attributes (phenotype, age, fertility, living status, exposure, etc.). It comes with a built-in model allowing basic genetic studies by simulations, performed according to parameter values such a penetrance matrix (phenotype probabilities for each genotype), exposure, between-relative mating probabilities, and a probability of migration in a two-dimensional migration process. The simulated populations could be analysed with different packages for statistical or genetical analysis (e.g., SAS, S-PLUS, Linkage, Mapmaker/sibs, Genehunter). Pedigrees can also be simulated according to a pedigree file at the LINKAGE format.
