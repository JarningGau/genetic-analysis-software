[TASSEL]
FULL_NAME=Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution, and Linkage
VERSION=2.0 (January 2006)
DESCRIPTION=TASSEL is a software package which performs a variety of genetic analyses. The analyses include association mapping, diversity estimation and calculating linkage disequilibrium. The association analysis between genotypes and phenotypes can be performed by either a general linear model or a mixed linear model. The general linear model now allows users to analyze complex field designs, environmental interactions, and epistatic interactions. The mixed model is specially designed to handle polygenic effects at multiple levels of relatedness including pedigree information. These new analyses should permit association analysis in a wide range plant and animal species.
