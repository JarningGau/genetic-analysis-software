[SNAP 2]
FULL NAME=SNp Annotation and Proxy search
VERSION=1.0 (August 2008)
DESCRIPTION=SNAP finds proxy SNPs based on linkage disequilibrium, physical distance and/or membership in more than 15 selected commercial genotyping arrays. Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium is pre-calculated based on phased genotype data from the International HapMap Project . Information about the genotyping arrays is based on data published by the vendors. SNAP also optionally returns current gene and SNP annotations, and can be used to generate graphical plots of LD structure, recombination rate and gene annotation.
