FULL_NAME=GRONingen university LOR score calculation
DESCRIPTION=Conversion programs from LINKAGE files are available. The program uses peeling and can employ nested conditioning. There is an automatic peeling program that will unravel (multiple) loops. Alleles do not need to be recoded, so real allele sizes can be used. Genotype probabilities for a chosen person can be calculated for purposes of genetic risk calculation. Later versions include one for calculations using linked markers and mutations and mosaicism, made by Martin van der Meulen. A symbolic versions will generate the formula to compute the pedigree likelihood.
