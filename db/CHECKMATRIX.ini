[CHECKMATRIX]
OTHER_NAME=: PY_MATRIX_2D
VERSION=v248
DESCRIPTION=CheckMatrix serves as a visualization tool to validate constructed genetic maps. CheckMatrix generates graphical genotypes and two-dimensional heat plots of pairwise scores. Visualization of regions with positive and negative linkage as well as of allele fraction per marker simplifies genetic map validation without applying statistical approaches. CheckMatrix works in conjunction with MadMapper and freely available at http://www.atgc.org/XLinkage/MadMapper/
