[LRTAE]
FULL_NAME=Likelihood Ratio Test Allowing for Errors
VERSION=1.3.1 (June 2005)
DESCRIPTION=The purpose of this program is to compute a likelihood ratio test statistic that increases power to detect genetic association in the presence of phenotype, genotype, and/or haplotype misclassification errors. In addition, the program produces asymptotically unbiased estimates of frequency parameters.
