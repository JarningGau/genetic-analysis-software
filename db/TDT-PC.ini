[TDT-PC]
FULL NAME=Transmission Disequilibrium Test Power Calculator
VERSION=1.3 (2002)
DESCRIPTION=TDT Power Calculator (TDT-PC) is a computer program to compute the statistical power of the Transmission/Disequilibrium Test (TDT) analytically, based on the most accurate asymptotic algorithms up to date, and is applicable in very general situations, where different parental disease status, multiple children, mixed family type and recombination events are considered. Routine algorithms for Monte Carlo simulations with significant improvements are also implemented in this program.
