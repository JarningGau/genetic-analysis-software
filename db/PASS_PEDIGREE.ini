[PASS PEDIGREE]
DESCRIPTION=PASS Pedigree is drawing the most complex family trees in a matter of minutes instead of hours of work. The basis of this is an algorithm for automatically builing a family tree. Of course, manual adjustments in the family tree can be made for your specific requirements. PASS Pedigree meets all international conventions concerning the drawing of pedigrees. A converter can convert historical Cyrillic pedigrees automatically to PASS Pedigree. Unlike before, all your family trees are stored in one single database. PASS Pedigree can intelligently connect to many genetic centers (e.g. three genetic centers in the Netherlands) with the existing patient information, via the lab system HELIX based on HL7 techniques.
