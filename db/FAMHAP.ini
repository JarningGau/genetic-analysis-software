[FAMHAP]
VERSION=16
DESCRIPTION=FAMHAP is a tool for haplotype association analysis of unphased genotype data. It can be used both for population data (case-control) and nuclear family data. The program is optimized for haplotype frequency estimation with the EM-algorithm for many markers. FAMHAP provides a method which searches for potential genotyping errors and several tests for haplotype-based association analysis. Particular emphasis is on Monte-Carlo simulations, which are necessary in the context of haplotype association, where asymptotic theory often fails, and in the context of multiple testing problems.
