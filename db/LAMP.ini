[LAMP]
FULL_NAME=Linkage and Association Modeling in Pedigrees
VERSION=0.0.9
DESCRIPTION=LAMP carries out parametric association analysis in samples of unrelated individuals, trios or large families. In addition to a test-statistic, a genetic model is estimated for each SNP. The approach is based on retrospective likelihood and can be used to analyze selected samples.
