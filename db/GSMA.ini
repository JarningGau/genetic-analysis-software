[GSMA]
FULL NAME=Genome Search Meta Analysis
DESCRIPTION=The GSMA is a rank-based meta-analysis method for analyzing results from genome-wide linkage searches. A software package is now available. The gsma software calculates the summed rank for any number of studies and bins, then obtains p-values for the Summed Rank and the Ordered Rank statistics, by simulation. Weighted and unweighted analyses are performed. A test data set is included.
