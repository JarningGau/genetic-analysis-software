[L-POP]
VERSION=Jan 2001
DESCRIPTION=L-POP detects population stratification in samples of unrelated individuals for whom a number of unlinked genotypes have been measured. \\ Using a latent class analysis model, population strata are defined such that unlinked markers are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium within classes. \\ L-POP calculates the posterior probabilities for each individual belonging to each of K classes, which can be used to correct for spurious effects of population stratification in tests of association.
