FULL_NAME=Estimation of Haplotype frequencies from Pooled DNA samples
DESCRIPTION=This program provides variance estimates for haplotype frequency estimates, it allows several kinds of missing information in the genotype data, it also allows for combined genotype data of different pool sizes. This program can be used for testing haplotype-disease associations in case control studies by calculating the likelihood ratio test: 2 log(likelihood for cases) + 2 log(likelihood for controls) - 2 log(likelihood for case+controls).
