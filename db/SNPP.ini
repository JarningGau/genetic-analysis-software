[SNPP]
FULL NAME=Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Processor
VERSION=1.0 (2003)
DESCRIPTION=a dynamic general database management system to manage high-throughput SNP genotyping data. It provides several functions, including data importing with comparison, Mendelian inheritance check within pedigrees, data compiling and exporting. Furthermore, SNPP may generate files for repeat genotyping and transform them into files that can be executed by a liquid handling system.
