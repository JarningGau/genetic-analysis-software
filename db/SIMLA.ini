FULL_NAME=SIMulation of pedigree data for Linkage and Association studies
VERSION=2.3 (Oct 2003)
DESCRIPTION=SIMLA is a SIMulation program that generates data sets of families for use in Linkage and Association studies. It allows the user flexibility in specifying marker and disease placement, locus heterogeneity, disequilibrium between markers and between markers and disease loci.
