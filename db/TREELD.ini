[TREELD]
VERSION=1.0 (Jan 2005)
DESCRIPTION=The package TreeLD is a free software tool for mapping complex trait loci. TreeLD performs a multipoint LD-analysis by inferring the ancestry of a genomic region and analyzing this ancestry for signals of disease mutations. The generated likelihoods can be used to test for the presence of a disease locus and to fine-map its location, providing a point estimate and a credible region. Furthermore, the package provides a novel way of visualizing the association signal in a sample. TreeLD is designed for high-density SNP haplotypes and can be applied to case-control data, TDT trio data and quantitative trait data.
