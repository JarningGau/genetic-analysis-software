[GENEFINDER]
VERSION=1.1.9 (June 2004)
DESCRIPTION=GeneFinder uses GEE method to estimate the location of the susceptibility gene based on the allele-sharing of affected sib pairs for multiple markers. GENEFINDER can further the analysis of GENEHUNTER by providing a more accurate gene location estimation and the corresponding confidence interval.
