[LINKAGE-IMPRINT]
FULL NAME=LINKAGE allowing for IMPRINITING
VERSION=January 2005
DESCRIPTION=We have developed a parametric model-based approach to analyzing pedigree data for genomic imprinting. We have modified widely used LINKAGE program to incorporate imprinting. In addition, the LINKAGE-IMPRINT program allows for the use of sex-specific recombination in the analysis, which is of particular importance in a genome-wide analysis for imprinted genes.
