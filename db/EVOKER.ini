[EVOKER]
VERSION=May 2010
DESCRIPTION=Evoker is a graphical tool for visualizing genotype intensity data in order to assess genotype calls as part of quality control procedures for genome-wide association studies. It provides a solution to the computational and storage problems related to being able to work with the huge volumes of data generated by such projects by implementing a compact, binary format that allows rapid access to data, even with hundreds of thousands of observations.
