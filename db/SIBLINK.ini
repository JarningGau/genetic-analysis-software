[SIBLINK]
VERSION=3.0
DESCRIPTION=SIBLINK allows the user to perform multipoint linkage analysis based on estimated IBD sharing between affected sibpairs. IBD sharing is inferred from IBS status, given marker genotypes, frequencies, and locations. Resulting LOD scores are maximized across a grid of possible disease locations and IBD sharing vectors.
