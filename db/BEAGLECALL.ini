[BEAGLECALL]
VERSION=1.0.0 (September 2010)
DESCRIPTION=BEAGLECALL is a software package for simultaneous genotype calling and haplotype phasing for unrelated individuals. BEAGLECALL produces output posterior genotype probabilities and output phased haplotypes. BEAGLECALL generates extremely accurate genotype calls because it uses both allele signal intensity data and inter-marker correlation to call genotypes. BEAGLECALL is designed for use with high-density SNP arrays, and it uses the BEAGLE haplotype frequency model to model inter-marker correlation.
