[PHASE]
VERSION=2.0 (Sept 2003)
DESCRIPTION=This program implements a new statistical method for reconstructing haplotypes from population genotype data. | new for v2: (1) the introduction of a new computational approach, resulting in much faster haplotype resolution. (2) the introduction of a new model that allows for recombination and decay of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with distance, which results in more accurate haplotype estimates. This model also allows the user to estimate recombination rates, and identify recombination hotspots from population genotype data. (3) the facility to perform a test for haplotype frequency differences between cases and controls. (4) more extensive output summarising the results.
