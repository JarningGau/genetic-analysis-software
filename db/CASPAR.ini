[CASPAR]
FULL NAME=Computerized Affected Sibling Pair Analyzer and Reporter
DESCRIPTION=CASPAR's main novel feature is conditional linkage analyses, in which the population can be subdivided according to criteria at some loci and analyzed for linkage at other loci. CASPAR uses simulation to overcome the problems inherent in such multiple testing.
