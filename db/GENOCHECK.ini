[GENOCHECK]
FULL_NAME=GenoCheck
VERSION=1.0 (sept 20, 1995)
DESCRIPTION=GenoCheck is a program designed to identify genotypes that are likely to be errors. The statistical method was designed to identify typing error rather than pedigree errors, but is general enough to pinpoint any unlikely genotype still consistent with Mendelian inheritance.
