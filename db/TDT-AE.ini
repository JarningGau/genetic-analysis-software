[TDT-AE]
FULL NAME=Transmission Disequilibrium Test Allowing for Errors
VERSION=2.01 (July 2004)
DESCRIPTION=This program computes a likelihood-based transmission disequilibrium test. The data are genotypes on trios (father, mother, affected child) in which random genotyping errors leading to Mendelian inconsistencies may or may not have occurred. This program computes the TDT-AE statistic on all trios (whether Mendelianly consistent or not) and thereby maintains a correct type I error rate in the presence of random genotyping errors.
