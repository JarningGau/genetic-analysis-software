[GENEHUNTER-PLUS]
VERSION=1.2 (Nov 1998)
DESCRIPTION=GENEHUNTER-PLUS is a modification of the GENEHUNTER software package which produces output files containing the null and conditional distributions of the test statistic (in nullprobs.dat and probs.dat, respectively). These files can then be used as input to the ASM program which incorporates the allele sharing modeling for lodscores and likelihood ratio tests as developed by Kong and Cox (1997).
