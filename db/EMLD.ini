FULL NAME=EM estimation of haplotype frequencies and LD calculation
VERSION=September 2003
DESCRIPTION=A quick and handy program to calculate pair-wise linkage disequilibrium based on SNP genotype data from unrelated individuals. EM algorithm is used to estimate pair-wise haplotype frequencies. The output file is in the format of input file for GOLD program, thus it can be directly plug into GOLD to get LD plots.
