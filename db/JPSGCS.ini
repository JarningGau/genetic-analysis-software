FULL NAME=Java Programs for Statistical Genetics and Computational Statistics
DESCRIPTION=These programs have been developed since 2002 to address problems in statistical genetics. However, they include several programs and packages that may be more generally useful, for instance, programs to draw and manipulate graphs, simulation programs, and programs to estimate graphical models.
