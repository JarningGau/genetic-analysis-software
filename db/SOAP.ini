[SOAP]
FULL_NAME=Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package
DESCRIPTION=SOAP provides full solution to next generation sequencing data analysis. Currently, it consists of a new alignment tool (SOAPaligner/soap2), a re-sequencing consensus sequence builder (SOAPsnp), an indel finder (SOAPindel), a structural variation scanner (SOAPsv) and a de novo short reads assembler (SOAPdenovo).
