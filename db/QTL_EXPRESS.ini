[QTL EXPRESS]
VERSION=August 2005
DESCRIPTION=A web-based user-friendly package to map Quantitative Trait Loci in outbred populations. Population structures catered for are line crosses, halfsib families, nuclear families and sibpairs. Permutation tests to determine empirical significance levels and bootstrapping to estimate empirical confidence intervals of QTL locations are optional. Fixed effects/covariates can be fitted and models may include single or multiple QTL. Results are presented in tabular and graphical format.
