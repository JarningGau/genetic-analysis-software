FULL_NAME=Meta-Analysis with Overlapping Subjects
DESCRIPTION=Data from genome-wide association studies are often analyzed jointly for the purposes of combining information from multiple studies of the same disease or comparing results across different disorders. In many instances, the same subjects appear in multiple studies. Failure to account for overlapping subjects can greatly inflate type I error when combining results from multiple studies of the same disease and can drastically reduce power when comparing results across different disorders. MAOS implements valid and efficient statistical methods for meta-analysis of genomewide association studies with overlapping subjects. The current release performs logistic regression analysis of individual level data under the additive mode of inheritance.
