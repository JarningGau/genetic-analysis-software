[SELSIM]
VERSION=2.1 (June 2005)
DESCRIPTION=When designing methods which provide the necessary power to detect regions of the genome which have experience historical selective pressures it is important to consider which patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of particular forms of natural selection. SELSIM is a program which can simulate population genetic data in which a single site has experienced natural selection.
