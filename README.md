## An Alphabetic List of Genetic Analysis Software

### Scope
Computer programs for genetics analysis, including but not limiting to topics of:

* Genetic linkage analysis for human pedigree data
* QTL analysis for animal/plant breeding data
* Genetic marker ordering
* Genetic association analysis
* Haplotype construction
* Population genetics
* Genetic data visualization

This list is initially offered as a service to the gene mapping community. The inclusion of a program should not be interpreted as an endorsement from us.

In the last few years, new technology has been producing new types of genetic data, and the scope of genetic analyses changes dramatically. It is no longer obvious whether a program should be included or excluded from this list. Topics such as next-generation-sequencing (NGS), gene expression, genomics annotation, etc. can all be relevant to a genetic study, but we'll have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to include a program.

### History
This list was created by Dr. [Wentian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XsMM0oQAAAAJ&hl=en) when he was at Columbia University (1995-1996). It was later moved to Rockefeller University (1996-2002) and then to the North Shore LIJ Research Institute (2002-2015), maintained by [Jurg Ott](http://www.jurgott.org/), who passed it on to his former student [Gao Wang](http://home.uchicago.edu/gaow) during the ASHG 2015 conference. More than 240 programs were listed by December 2004, close to 400 programs by December 2006, close to 480 programs by November 2008, and over 600 programs by October 2012. Since 2015, the list takes its home on [github](https://github.com) to facilicate potential contributions from the community.

### R packages
More and more packages are now written in R. To be consistent, any R package in CRAN has been renamed from [package-name] to R/[package-name]. If an R package is not submitted to CRAN, its original name has been kept.
