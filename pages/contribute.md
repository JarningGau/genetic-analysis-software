## Contribution Guidelines
Numerous analysis software are being developed as our field continues to flourish. We need your contribution to keep the list up-to-date!

To contribute, please provide information of the software in `*.ini` format taking the form of [this template](https://github.com/gaow/genetic-analysis-software/blob/master/db/template.ini). You may include less properties of the software than the template suggests (for example it may not have a version number or executable names) but please do not introduce new properties as they will be ignored when the pages are generated.

Once you have completed the `*.ini` file, you may either fork this repository, add the `*.ini` file to `db` folder, commit and send a github pull request, or you can simply email the `*.ini` file to <gaow@uchicago.edu> preferably with the phrase "Rockefeller List" in your email subject.
