#PLINK/SEQ
##Description
PLINK/SEQ is an open-source C/C++ library for working with human genetic variation data. The specific focus is to provide a platform for analytic tool development for variation data from large-scale resequencing projects, particularly whole-exome and whole-genome studies. However, the library could in principle be applied to other types of genetic studies, including whole-genome association studies of common SNPs.
